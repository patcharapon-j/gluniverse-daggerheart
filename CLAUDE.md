# GLUniverse — Daggerheart

An unofficial Foundry VTT game system for Daggerheart, built on the design
system in `design/`.

## Layout

- `system.json` — the Foundry manifest. `documentTypes` declares the four
  Actor subtypes and the ten Item subtypes; `styles` lists the sheets in load
  order, tokens first.
- `design/` — **the design system, and the source of truth for the look.**
  Standalone HTML study pages plus the component modules they are built from.
  It runs on its own at `http://localhost:4173/design/` with no build step.
  `design/system.html` is the written study of why everything is the way it is.
- `src/module/` — the system proper.
  - `config.ts` — the closed sets: traits, domains, tiers, ranges, severities.
    Anything a table can extend (classes, ancestries) is content, not config.
  - `data/` — DataModels. Derivation lives here; the schema owns the numbers.
  - `documents/` — Actor and Item behaviour. Marking, equipping, applying
    damage. One implementation each, shared by the sheet and the chat card.
  - `dice/` — the roll engine and the chat plate.
  - `sheets/` — Svelte 5 sheet components.
  - `apps/` — the ApplicationV2 ↔ Svelte bridge.
  - `ui/` — **vendored** from `design/`. Do not edit; see below.
- `src/packs-src/` — compendium source, one module per pack. See below.
- `styles/` — **ported** from `design/`. Do not edit; see below.
- `scripts/port-design-css.mjs`, `scripts/port-design-js.mjs` — the port.
- `scripts/build-packs.mjs` — compiles `src/packs-src/` into `dist/packs/`.

## The port

`design/` is authored as whole documents; a Foundry system owns a subtree of
somebody else's. The two port scripts carry the design across and change only
what has to change:

    :root        → .dh                 the palette is scoped to our own root,
    :root.light  → html.dh-light .dh   or --ink and --paper leak into every
    body.ramp    → .dh.ramp            other package on the page.
    <selector>   → .dh <selector>      and so does everything else — see below.
    /design/assets/ → ../assets/       relative to `styles/`, where it lands.

Everything Foundry renders is wrapped in `.dh` — sheet roots via
`DEFAULT_OPTIONS.classes`, chat cards via the wrapper in `dice/rolls.ts`.

**Every ported selector is qualified with `.dh`.** Foundry imports our sheets
into the `system` cascade layer, which it declares *after* `elements`,
`blocks` and `applications` — so an unqualified rule of ours does not merely
compete with Foundry's, it wins outright regardless of specificity. The design
names things the way a document that owns itself may (`.tabs`, `.rail`,
`.win`, `.slot`, `.card`, `.pk`), and Foundry uses most of those for its own
furniture. `.tabs button` took the icon font off all thirteen sidebar tabs.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Anything we draw **outside** a `.dh` root needs the class itself. Two do:
  the swap's drag proxy and the context menu, both on `<body>` so no scroller
  can clip them. Both wear `dh`, and the port rewrites `.dragproxy` →
  `.dh.dragproxy` and `.ctxm` → `.dh.ctxm`. Note it rewrites the *class*, not
  just the root selector, so descendants work too: `.ctxm .mi` has to become
  `.dh.ctxm .mi`, and `.dh .ctxm .mi` — what the scoper would have written —
  matches nothing.
- Scoping does **not** help when two of *our own* sheets collide, because both
  are inside `.dh`. That is a name clash in the design system and is fixed in
  `design/`: `.die.win` became `.die.lit` (it was taking `.win`, the sheet
  window) and `.dfn .pl` became `.dfn .crest` (it was taking `.pl`, the chat
  plate). Study pages load one stylesheet at a time and cannot show this; the
  system loads all of them at once, so it always will.

Paths in CSS are the other thing that does not survive the move. A relative
`url()` resolves against the **stylesheet**, not the document — including one
substituted from a custom property set inline. `src/module/assets.ts` puts
every JS-set `--art`/`--pic` through `getRoute`; the port rewrites the ones
written in the stylesheets. Chat is stricter still: Foundry's sanitiser strips
`<svg>` and `url()` styles out of stored message content, so a posted card is
stored as its *options* and redrawn on render (`sheets/post-card.ts`,
`dice/chat.ts`).

**Edit `design/`, then re-run the scripts.** Editing `styles/` or
`src/module/ui/` directly means the next port silently reverts you, and the
study pages stop describing the system they are about.

    node scripts/port-design-css.mjs
    node scripts/port-design-js.mjs

A new component in `design/` is **three registrations**, not one: the file
list in the port script, and — for CSS — the `styles` array in `system.json`.
Foundry reads that array once at server start, so a newly added stylesheet
does not appear on a browser reload. Restart Foundry.

`tools/verify/` is a page that loads the *ported* sheets and asserts the
things the port could silently break — that the palette resolves inside `.dh`,
that it does not leak to `:root`, that a plate is still exactly 300px. Open it
at `http://localhost:4173/tools/verify/` after any port.

## Compendium content

`src/packs-src/*.mjs` each default-export an array of normalized documents;
`_helpers.mjs` has one constructor per Item subtype so a class reads like the
page it came from. `build-packs.mjs` gives every document a **stable `_id`**
derived from `pack:type:name` — rebuild as often as you like and a character
who dragged a card off the compendium stays linked to it. Rename a card and
that link breaks, which is the honest outcome and why the id is not random.

The script also creates the folders entries ask for by name, and checks that
`system.json` declares exactly the packs it built. A pack the manifest does
not know about is never mounted, and nothing says so.

| Pack | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `classes` | 9 classes and 54 subclass cards, foldered by class |
| `heritage` | 18 ancestries and 9 communities |
| `domains` | 189 domain cards, foldered by domain, in deck order |

A subclass is three documents, not one — Foundation, Specialization, Mastery —
because that is how you acquire it. `subclassCards()` does the expansion so
the source stays one entry per subclass.

Ancestries and communities share a pack because heritage is one line on the
sheet and one choice at the table — "wildborne faun" — and two compendiums
would mean two windows to fill in one field. They are still two Item
subtypes. An ancestry's features are `top` and `bottom`, named for where they
sit on the card rather than for what they do, because the position *is* the
rule: mixed ancestry takes the top of one and the bottom of another, which is
why a goblin-orc can be Surefooted or Sturdy but never both.

Neither carries a domain mark. In this system a saturated hue means domain, so
they take the design's own type glyphs from `assets/types/`.

**Domain card text is extracted, not transcribed.**
`tools/extract-domain-cards.mjs` reads the Domain Card Reference appendix out
of `docs/rules/` and writes `src/packs-src/domain-cards.mjs`. It is committed;
re-run the extractor rather than editing it. Most appendix pages are
three-column fixed-width text, so the tool finds the gutters and cuts each
line at its own whitespace — a page-wide cut shears the long body lines one
way and the indented card titles the other. It refuses to write unless the
result is nine domains with three cards at level 1 and two at every level
after, which is what the book contains.

    node tools/extract-domain-cards.mjs

## Why Svelte

The mark animations. A wound lands whole in 160ms and then bleeds for 340ms; a
sheet that rebuilds its markup on every update takes that with it. Svelte's
fine-grained updates keep the DOM, and `Marks.svelte` / `Gems.svelte` push it
further — they render once and drive every later change through the design's
own `setMarks` / `setPool`, which diff the row and animate only what moved.

## Build

`npm run build` compiles `src/` into `dist/module/daggerheart.js`, copies
`system.json`, `lang/`, `styles/` and `assets/` into `dist/`, compiles the
compendium packs into `dist/packs/`, then junctions root `module/` and
`packs/` at `dist/` so Foundry can load this folder in place. `dist/` is the
root of the packaged `system.zip`.

`npm run typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit` and `svelte-check`.

## `data-pk` is the sheet's one handle

Four things are delegated off the character sheet's root, and all four find
their subject the same way — the nearest ancestor carrying `data-pk`, which
is an item id:

| gesture | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| click | posts the card to chat (`onCardClick`) |
| right-click | the context menu (`onCardMenu` → `ui/menu.js`) |
| hover | the peek layer (`ui/peek.js`) |
| dragstart | hands Foundry `{type:"Item", uuid}` so the item can leave |

So a row gets all four by carrying `data-pk`, and a row that omits it gets
none — which is how the inventory list ended up being the one thing on the
sheet that could not be deleted. Put it on every row that stands for an item,
even one with no card to show: the click and the peek both look their subject
up and quietly do nothing when there is nothing to draw.

The vault's own rows carry `data-swap` as well and are excluded from the
native drag — they already drag on pointer events, and a browser drag
starting underneath takes the gesture away mid-swap.

## Chat

**Foundry draws every message twice** — once into the log and once as the
notification that floats over the board — from two separate calls about three
milliseconds apart. Two elements, one message. Anything keyed on the message
id that fires "only the first time" therefore serves one of the two and
silently skips the other, and which one you are looking at is a coin flip.
`dice/chat.ts` allows both and rejects anything later; see `TWIN`.

The plate is **veiled** until it lands: field, ghost word, verdict, claim row
and the critical's whole material are held back while the dice tumble, so the
card does not answer the question it is still asking. It is presentation only
— the result is in the markup from the first frame — and a client that never
runs the arrival never wears the veil. See the veil block at the foot of
`design/plate.css` and `dice/arrival.ts`.

**`play` and `land` are two different claims, and every arrival rule needs
both.** `land` means *settled* and is worn by every re-render of the log;
`play.land` means *this client just watched it land*. Foundry re-renders a
message whenever anything is written to it, so a rule keyed on `land` alone
replays each time — and exactly one outcome writes to its own message, the
GM's Fear at `ARRIVAL`, which is why Fear was the one roll that landed twice.
The sweep already knew this; the dice, verdict, numeral and claim row did not.
It costs nothing to qualify because every arrival keyframe ends on the
element's natural value, so a re-render is handed the end state rather than
travelling to it.

`ARRIVAL` is that write's delay, and it is measured against **the longest
thing the landing starts** — currently the sweep, at 640ms after a 40ms delay
on top of `TUMBLE`. A re-render replaces the element, so a write that lands
inside the arrival cuts it off mid-flight.

## Not done yet

- Compendium content — character creation is covered: classes, subclasses,
  ancestries, communities and the domain decks. Equipment and the adversary
  roster are still to come, as is everything from *Hope and Fear*.
- Character creation, level-up, death moves and scars.
- The Fear HUD (`design/pool.js`) and the GM screen.
