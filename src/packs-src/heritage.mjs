      Clanks are sentient mechanical beings built from a variety of materials,
      including metal, wood, and stone. They can resemble humanoids, animals,
      or even inanimate objects. Like organic beings, their bodies come in a
      wide array of sizes. Because of their bespoke construction, many clanks
      have highly specialized physical configurations. Examples include clawed
      hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in weaponry. Many
      clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as function, and
      members of other ancestries often turn to clank artisans to construct
      customized mobility aids and physical adornments. Other ancestries can
      create clanks, even using their own physical characteristics as
      inspiration, but it’s also common for clanks to build one another. A
      clank’s lifespan extends as long as they’re able to acquire or craft new
      parts, making their physical form effectively immortal. That said, their
      minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate as the magic
      that powers them loses potency.`,

      Drakona resemble wingless dragons in humanoid form and possess a powerful
      elemental breath. All drakona have thick scales that provide excellent
      natural armor against both attacks and the forces of nature. They are
      large in size, ranging from 5 feet to 7 feet on average, with long sharp
      teeth. New teeth grow throughout a drakona’s approximately 350-year
      lifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor.
      Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona don’t have wings and can’t fly
      without magical aid. Members of this ancestry pass down the element of
      their breath through generations, though in rare cases, a drakona’s
      elemental power will differ from the rest of their family’s.`,

      Dwarves are most easily recognized as short humanoids with square frames,
      dense musculature, and thick hair. Their average height ranges from 4 to
      5 ½ feet, and they are often broad in proportion to their stature. Their
      skin and nails contain a high amount of keratin, making them naturally
      resilient. This allows dwarves to embed gemstones into their bodies and
      decorate themselves with tattoos or piercings. Their hair grows
      thickly—usually on their heads, but some dwarves have thick hair across
      their bodies as well. Dwarves of all genders can grow facial hair, which
      they often style in elaborate arrangements. Typically, dwarves live up to
      250 years of age, maintaining their muscle mass well into later life.`,

      Elves are typically tall humanoids with pointed ears and acutely attuned
      senses. Their ears vary in size and pointed shape, and as they age, the
      tips begin to droop. While elves come in a wide range of body types, they
      are all fairly tall, with heights ranging from about 6 to 6 ½ feet. All
      elves have the ability to drop into a celestial trance, rather than
      sleep. This allows them to rest effectively in a short amount of time.
      Some elves possess what is known as a “mystic form,” which occurs when an
      elf has dedicated themself to the study or protection of the natural
      world so deeply that their physical form changes. These characteristics
      can include celestial freckles, the presence of leaves, vines, or flowers
      in their hair, eyes that flicker like fire, and more. Sometimes these
      traits are inherited from parents, but if an elf changes their
      environment or magical focus, their appearance changes over time. Because
      elves live for about 350 years, these traits can shift more than once
      throughout their lifespan.`,

      Faeries are winged humanoid creatures with insectile features. These
      characteristics cover a broad spectrum from humanoid to insectoid—some
      possess additional arms, compound eyes, lantern organs, chitinous
      exoskeletons, or stingers. Because of their close ties to the natural
      world, they also frequently possess attributes that allow them to blend
      in with various plants. The average height of a faerie ranges from about
      2 feet to 5 feet, but some faeries grow up to 7 feet tall. All faeries
      possess membranous wings and they each go through a process of
      metamorphosis. The process and changes differ from faerie to faerie, but
      during this transformation each individual manifests the unique
      appearance they will carry throughout the rest of their approximately
      50-year lifespan.`,

      Fauns resemble humanoid goats with curving horns, square pupils, and
      cloven hooves. Though their appearances may vary, most fauns have a
      humanoid torso and a goatlike lower body covered in dense fur. Faun faces
      can be more caprine or more humanlike, and they have a wide variety of
      ear and horn shapes. Faun horns range from short with minimal curvature
      to much larger with a distinct curl. The average faun ranges from 4 feet
      to 6 ½ feet tall, but their height can change dramatically from one
      moment to the next based on their stance. The majority of fauns have
      proportionately long limbs, no matter their size or shape, and are known
      for their ability to deliver powerful blows with their split hooves.
      Fauns live for roughly 225 years, and as they age, their appearance can

      Firbolgs are bovine humanoids typically recognized by their broad noses
      and long, drooping ears. Some have faces that are a blend of humanoid and
      bison, ox, cow, or other bovine creatures. Others, often referred to as
      minotaurs, have heads that entirely resemble cattle. They are tall and
      muscular creatures, with heights ranging from around 5 feet to 7 feet,
      and possess remarkable strength no matter their age. Some firbolgs are
      known to use this strength to charge their adversaries, an action that is
      particularly effective for those who have one of the many varieties of
      horn styles commonly found in this ancestry. Though their unique
      characteristics can vary, all firbolgs are covered in fur, which can be
      muted and earth-toned in color, or come in a variety of pastels, such as
      soft pinks and blues. On average, firbolgs live for about 150 years.`,

      earth tones to bright reds, yellows, purples, and blues. Fungril display
      an incredible variety of bodies, faces, and limbs, as there’s no single
      common shape among them. Even their heights range from a tiny 2 feet tall
      to a staggering 7 feet tall. While the common lifespan of a fungril is
      about 300 years, some have been reported to live much longer. They can
      communicate nonverbally, and many members of this ancestry use a mycelial
      array to chemically exchange information with other fungril across long
      distances.`,

      height, and their head and body shapes can resemble any type of turtle.
      Galapa come in a variety of earth tones—most often shades of green and
      brown—and possess unique patterns on their shells. Members of this
      ancestry can draw their head, arms, and legs into their shell for
      protection to use it as a natural shield when defensive measures are
      needed. Some supplement their shell’s strength or appearance by attaching
      armor or carving unique designs, but the process is exceedingly painful.
      Most galapa move slowly no matter their age, and they can live
      approximately 150 years.`,

      three eyes. Adult giants range from 6 ½ to 8 ½ feet tall and are
      naturally muscular, regardless of body type. They are easily recognized
      by their wide frames and elongated arms and necks. Though they can have
      up to three eyes, all giants are born with none and remain sightless for
      their first year of life. Until a giant reaches the age of 10 and their
      features fully develop, the formation of their eyes may fluctuate. Those
      with a single eye are commonly known as cyclops. The average giant
      lifespan is about 75 years.`,

      to move through less-optimal environments with ease. Their skin and eye
      colors are incredibly varied, with no one hue, either vibrant or subdued,
      more dominant than another. A typical goblin stands between 3 feet and 4
      feet tall, and each of their ears is about the size of their head.
      Goblins are known to use ear positions to very specific effect when
      communicating nonverbally. A goblin’s lifespan is roughly 100 years, and

      nose, and feet are larger in proportion to the rest of their body.
      Members of this ancestry live for around 150 years, and a halfling’s
      appearance is likely to remain youthful even as they progress from
      adulthood into old age. Halflings are naturally attuned to the magnetic
      fields of the Mortal Realm, granting them a strong internal compass. They

      under 5 feet to about 6 ½ feet. They have a wide variety of builds, with
      some being quite broad, others lithe, and many inhabiting the spectrum in
      between. Humans are physically adaptable and adjust to harsh climates
      with relative ease. In general, humans live to an age of about 100, with

      have long fingers and pointed nails. Some have long, thin, and smooth
      tails that end in points, forks, or arrowheads. It’s common for infernis
      to have two or four horns—though some have crowns of many horns, or only
      one. These horns can also grow asymmetrically, forming unique, often
      curving, shapes that infernis enhance with carving and ornamentation.
      Their skin, hair, and horns come in an assortment of colors that can
      include soft pastels, stark tones, or vibrant hues, such as rosy scarlet,
      deep purple, and pitch black.

      Infernis possess a “dread visage” that manifests both involuntarily, such
      as when they experience fear or other strong emotions, or purposefully,
      such as when they wish to intimidate an adversary. This visage can
      briefly modify their appearance in a variety of ways, including
      lengthening their teeth and nails, changing the colors of their eyes,
      twisting their horns, or enhancing their height. On average, infernis
      live up to 350 years, with some attributing this lifespan to their

      adding to their heightened senses. Katari may look more or less feline or
      humanoid, with catlike attributes in the form of hair, whiskers, and a
      muzzle. About half of the katari population have tails. Their skin and
      fur come in a wide range of hues and patterns, including solid colors,
      calico tones, tabby stripes, and an array of spots, patches, marbling, or

      consuming food. Instead, many orcs choose to decorate their tusks with
      significant ornamentation. Orcs typically live for 125 years, and unless
      altered, their tusks continue to grow throughout the course of their
      lives. Their ears are pointed, and their hair and skin typically have

      material wealth. While this can take a variety of forms depending on the

      around military prowess. In such a case, it’s not uncommon for orderborne

      equipment to move both people and products across difficult terrain. As
      such, ridgeborne grow up scrambling and climbing, making them sturdy and
      strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety of forms—some
      cities carve out entire cliff faces, others construct castles of stone,
      and still more live in small homes on windblown peaks. Outside forces
      often struggle to attack ridgeborne groups, as the small militias and

      groups live along the shore, constructing ports for locals and travelers
      alike. These harbors function as centers of commerce, tourist
      attractions, or even just a safe place to lay down one’s head after weeks
      of travel. Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large
      ships, with the idea of “home” comprising a ship and its crew, rather
      than any one landmass. No matter their exact location, seaborne
      communities are closely tied to the ocean tides and the creatures who
      inhabit them. Seaborne learn to fish at a young age, and train from birth
      to hold their breath and swim in even the most tumultuous waters.

      skills, and many become captains of vessels, whether within their own
      community, working for another, or even at the helm of a powerful naval
